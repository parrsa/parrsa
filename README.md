💫 About Me
👋 Hello! I'm Parsa Soli, a passionate and dedicated Frontend Developer with over 3 years of professional experience building modern, responsive web applications. I'm currently a Senior Frontend Developer at RRF-Co, where I work with cutting-edge technologies like React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript.

🎓 I'm also pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering while actively contributing to the developer community through mentoring and technical leadership roles.

🚀 My expertise spans the entire frontend ecosystem, from UI/UX implementation with Tailwind CSS and Material-UI to state management with Redux and React Query, and from performance optimization to building scalable, maintainable architectures.
